                <h4 class="mt-0">Caleb Andrews | Flyer Speed Creation</h4>
                <p>At my current job we did a challenge to test our speed with designing. We had to pick from a list of
                    three different made up companies and pick to design a hero section, a flyer, or an Instagram post.
                    I wanted to test my skills with some graphic design, so I chose the flyer for a fictional spa
                    company
                    called GlowHaus. We had 30 minutes to show what we created.
                </p>

                <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
                <p>We started with some brainstorming. We had only five minutes to come up with a moodboard and find as
                    many inspiration pieces as we could.
                </p>

                <h2>Sketching Wireframes</h2>
                <p>Again we only had five minutes to come up with at least three wireframe sketches. This was new to me,
                    because I am used to taking my time crafting sketches. But this exercise pushed me into getting my
                    ideas
                    out faster. I think this helped me to understand that you want to get some of your original ideas
                    out
                    first and quick so you really have to think harder for the more creative ideas.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Design</h2>
                <p>Finally, we only had 20 minutes to execute our designs. We had to see what we could create in this
                    short amount of time so we weren't looking for perfection. But I was really surprised to see what I
                    could create in just 30 minutes. Even if it is basic I could come up with something fast. This
                    exercise taught me that I can work faster and still be efficient. It takes speed to push out all the
                    basic ideas to help you find the creative more original ideas.</p>
