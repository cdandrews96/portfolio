                <h4 class="mt-0">Caleb Andrews | Website Creation</h4>
                <p>This project was one I felt truly passionate about. Designing a website for a pool design company
                    offered the perfect balance of creativity and professionalism.
                    Their unique branding inspired me to create a site that felt both professional and fun.
                </p>

                <h2>Word Mapping</h2>
                <p>To kick off the project, I explored the company's existing branding and current website to understand
                    their visual identity and tone. They also provided a detailed
                    form outlining their target audience, which helped me define who the site needed to speak to. From
                    there, I created a list of descriptive words that captured
                    the essence of their brand and services—bolding the most impactful ones to serve as creative anchors
                    throughout the design process. These keywords became the
                    foundation for the visual direction and overall mood of the site.

                <h2>Creating a Moodboard</h2>
                <p>After creating the word map I needed to gather some inspiration in a moodboard. I needed to look at
                    some rock band posters as well as medical sites.
                    I gathered a bunch of insporation from various sites and added them in my Figma file. I wanted to
                    see how it rock band posters looked with medical sites
                    side by side. When I saw them I was able to write down some notes on each one to help with my
                    wireframing and final design ideas.

                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>I did some quick sketching to play around with the layout of the sites home page.
                </p>

                        target=”_blank”>Figma Mockup</a></h2>
                <p>Next I came up with a design I created in <a class="text-link"
                        href="https://www.figma.com/design/bdNDCMsVwED8Fpm0LC1yJJ/Artisan-Pool---Design?node-id=3-2&t=908vJZPrY6YbX6SY-1"
                        target=”_blank”>Figma</a> so that I could get feedback on the design decisions from my other
                    team members.</p>
