                <h1>HeadMeds Website Build</h1>
                <p>HeadMeds is a company owned by pain medicine specialists who helps with headaches and helping people with pain relief medicine in a cost effective way. 
                    In this build I aimed to bring the the feeling of a medical site, but with a more grundgy feel to match with the skull in their branding.
                </p>

                <h2>Word Mapping</h2>
                <p>Before I started I created a word map to help me identify the feel of the site. I wrote down all the words that came to mind from the clients 
                    description of their company. They were veteran owned and based off the logo it seemed like they were going for grundgy poster look for their brand. 
                    I had to figure out how to keep that look but also make it look like a trustworthy site fitting for a medical company.
                </p>

                <h2>Creating a Moodboard</h2>
                <p>After creating the word map I needed to gather some inspiration in a moodboard. I needed to look at some rock band posters as well as medical sites. 
                    I gathered a bunch of insporation from various sites and added them in my Figma file. I wanted to see how it rock band posters looked with medical sites 
                    side by side. When I saw them I was able to write down some notes on each one to help with my wireframing and final design ideas.

                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>After establishing a good sense of how the styling is going to go. I did some wireframing to figure out the layout of the site. 
                    Since I was building in Wordpress it was better to start with desktop view first.

                <h2>Final Design</h2>
                <p>Once I got all finished with the planning I came up with this final design:</p>
